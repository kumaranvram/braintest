###Left or Right - Let's play!

This is an application to developed for demonstrating how to use [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/product) device with a web page.

This application gives a series of question with two options. If a leap motion device is attached to the machine, you can swipe in the direction of the choice to choose that answer. In absence of a leap motion device, you may also click in the options instead.

The app is built only with

* HTML
* CSS 3
* jQuery

So use a CSS 3 compatible browser for better experience.
